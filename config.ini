# === Factorio Executable Location ===

# Select how the tool locates the Factorio executable.
# Options:
#   fixed_path – Use a fixed folder path (see below)
#   active_window_monitor – Auto-detect the active Factorio instance from the last focused window
factorio_locator_method = active_window_monitor

# Full path to the Factorio executable. Required if using `fixed_path` mode.
# Examples:
#   Windows: C:/Program Files/Factorio/bin/x64/factorio.exe
#   Linux:   /home/user/.factorio/bin/x64/factorio
#   macOS:   /Applications/factorio.app/Contents/MacOS/factorio or /Applications/factorio.app

# === Map Preview Generation ===

[map_exchange_input]

# Method used to provide the map exchange string.
# Options:
#   clipboard_monitor – Auto-detect valid map string from clipboard
#   file_monitor      – Watch a file for changes, useful when connected to another tool
map_exchange_input_method = clipboard_monitor

# How often to check for new map strings (in seconds)

[upload]

# How previews should be uploaded:
# Options:
#   rclone – Use rclone to sync with a remote (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
#   skip   – Skip upload entirely (or user handles previews externally)
upload_method = rclone

# Path to the rclone executable. If set to "auto", will try to auto-detect for current OS/arch and uses the bundled  one.
# Examples:
#   Windows: ./third_party/rclone/rclone.exe
#   Linux:   ./third_party/rclone/rclone
#   macOS:   ./third_party/rclone/rclone
rclone_executable = auto

# Name of the rclone remote:
#   - "dropbox_auto" will trigger an automatic Dropbox-only setup and use the remote name 'FactorioPreviewToolkitDropbox'.
#     If no rclone config exists yet, one will be created automatically via `rclone config create`.
#     This works only with Dropbox and requires browser authorization.
#
#   - If set manually (e.g., dropbox, onedrive, gdrive), it must match a remote name configured via `rclone config`.
#     You must configure this manually yourself using `rclone config` on the rclone executable.
#     !!! Ensure the service supports direct, static image linking !!!
#     Some services (like Google Drive) do not support direct/public links by default and are not officially supported.

rclone_remote_service = dropbox_auto

# Remote folder inside your rclone target (e.g., FactorioPreviews/)
remote_upload_dir = FactorioPreviews/
